The deployment is failing because:

1. Render runs `yarn start`
2. Yarn looks for a "start" script in package.json  
3. No "start" script exists in package.json
4. Yarn throws error: `Command "start" not found`

SOLUTION: Add "start": "node start-production.js" to package.json scripts section.

All technical components are ready:
✅ start-production.js exists and works
✅ Server fixed to listen in production mode  
✅ Module imports resolved
✅ Build process perfect (3.79s)

Only missing: One line in package.json
