# Render Deployment - Final Solution

## Root Cause Found ✅
Yarn documentation confirms: `yarn start` looks for a `"start"` script in package.json.
Our package.json is missing this script, causing the deployment failure.

## Simple Fix Required:

### 1. Add Start Script to package.json
Add this line to the `"scripts"` section of package.json:
```json
"start": "node start-production.js"
```

### 2. Complete scripts section should look like:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node start-production.js",
  "dev": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
  "build": "vite build && tsc -p tsconfig.server.json",
  "check": "tsc",
  "db:push": "drizzle-kit push"
}
```

## All Other Issues Already Fixed ✅
- ✅ `start-production.js` script created and ready
- ✅ Server listening fixed for production mode  
- ✅ Module import paths resolved
- ✅ Build process working perfectly (3.79s)
- ✅ Port handling configured for Render

## Expected Result:
After adding the start script:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Render will automatically detect and use `yarn start`
3. Yarn will find the start script and execute `node start-production.js`
4. Server will start successfully on production

## Status: Ready for Deployment
Only missing: One line in package.json scripts section.
